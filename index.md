The field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML and AI) 
is rapidly evolving, and increasingly being applied to diverse research domains.
One challenge faced by the ML community is the growing need for scalable resources
to make training and deploying models efficient, or in some cases, possible.
This includes increasing storage needs as datasets grow in size,
increasing hardware needs for CPUs, GPUs, and RAM for training models,
and an increasing desire to outsource computation as the time required to train models increases.
These challenges mean many researchers using ML are moving onto High Performance
Computers (HPC) to gain access to storage and compute resources.

As ML applies to a variety of scientific domains beyond computer science,
many researchers who wish to harness the power of ML and AI are confronted with the learning curve
for data science and ML, as well as the learning curve for using
high performance computing facilities. Existing HPC training 
does not always cater for the needs of Machine Learning community.

As such, this training course wants to acknowledge the confluence of
Machine Learning and High Performance Computing, and provide the tools and 
resources necessary to start moving your ML models onto the HPC.
This course is not an introduction to ML as many great courses exist on this 
topic already, but focusses on the challenge of moving from your local environment
(laptop, desktop, workstation) into a HPC environment. 

This course has been designed as a series of self-contained modules,
to make it easy for learners to "choose their own adventure". 
Some learners may want to look at every module, others may want to bare
essentials to get going and return to these materials as they need more
information. These materials have also been designed so that they can 
be completed without an instructor, but you can always reach out for 
assistance at help@massive.org.au if you get stuck.
